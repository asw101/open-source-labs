# Two dates per lab, deliberately kept separate:
#
#   updated    Derived from git. The last *substantive* commit touching the
#              lab. Sweeping edits are ignored, so a repo-wide docs pass does
#              not make every lab look fresh.
#   validated  Asserted in labs.json by whoever last ran the lab against Azure
#              and saw it work. Cannot be derived; a commit is not evidence
#              that anything deploys.
#
# A lab whose `updated` is newer than its `validated` has changed since anyone
# last proved it works — that is the signal worth acting on, and it is why the
# two dates are not collapsed into one.
#
# Auxiliary lab walkthroughs such as BASTION.md and PORTAL.md are outside this
# ledger. The deployment-evidence track records commands run against Azure and
# establishes whether a template deploys. No repository script validates
# Markdown snippets, so their correctness is a review-time concern rather than
# evidence that can be recorded as a method token.
#
# A commit does not count towards `updated` when it:
#   - touches SWEEP_THRESHOLD or more labs (a repo-wide sweep, not lab work)
#   - carries a `Freshness: skip` trailer (explicit opt-out)
#   - is authored by a bot (dependabot bumps are not lab changes)

# Two ranked tokens form the deployment-evidence track: a real deployment is
# strictly stronger proof than a preview, so recording `deploy` satisfies a
# requirement for `what-if`. Everything else is additive and must be present
# exactly, because those tokens assert different properties rather than
# stronger versions of the same one — `arm-diff` says generated ARM matches its
# source, which is not a weaker form of "it deploys".
#
# `required` states the weakest method that counts as validated. It lives in
# labs.json beside the record so there is one source of truth.
